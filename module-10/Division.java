/*Create an abstract Division class with fields for a company's division name and account number
and an abstract display () method that will be defined in the subclasses.
Use a constructor in the superclass that requires values for both fields.
Create two subclasses named InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision.
The InternationalDivision class includes a field for the country in which the division is located,
a field for the language spoken, and a constructor that requires all fields when created.
The DomesticDivision class includes a field for the state in which the division is located and 
a constructor that requires all fields when created.â€¯
Write an application named UseDivision that creates two instances of each of these concrete classes 
(4 total instances). */
